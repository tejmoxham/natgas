A project exploring forecasting models of natural gas import/export flows from UK.


File 1
Visualisation of datasets and some basic statistical anlysis.

File 2
A basic arima/sarima model of net montly netural gas imports
- Trend, season and error decomposition 
- Checking for time series stationarity.
- Rolling train/test set and evaluation.
- Plots forecasting into the future.
- Inclusion of confidence intervals

Fctors which may affect: GBP/USD, temperature, 

File 4
A gravity based model



## Future Developments
- Using higher resolution dataset day/week timeframe
- Examining imports by country
- Incorporating AIS data and country of origin 
- Economic center of mass model
- Individual time series models of sources to account for different time frames.

- Time series decomposition of UK gas imports.
- Trying to come up with a model for trend forecasting based on other factors.
- Using a gravity model and looking at imports from individual countries.

Why Forecast Gas Imports:  Gas imports matter to foreign energy policy of any country with a strong industry sector (such as
Germany or China), and for the strategy on pipeline/LNG1 infrastructure development.
